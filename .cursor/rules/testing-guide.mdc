# Testing Rules

- **Framework**: Use gtest/gmock for C++ tests.
- **Coverage**: New features must include tests whenever applicable.
- **Completeness**: Always include boundary cases and error paths.
- **Determinism**: Tests must be deterministic and runnable independently (no hidden state dependencies).
- **Performance**: Add benchmarks for performance-critical code paths when appropriate.
- **Test-Driven Completeness**: When implementing features across dialects, use similar testing structures to ensure comprehensive coverage.
