# Collaboration Rules

## Commits (Angular Commit Convention)

- Must follow the [Commit Message Guideline](https://github.com/fractalyze/.github/blob/main/COMMIT_MESSAGE_GUIDELINE.md).

- Format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <summary>
  ```
  where `type` ∈ {build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style, test}.

- Commit body: explain **why** the change was made (minimum 20 characters).

- Footer: record breaking changes, deprecations, and related issues/PRs.

- Each commit must include only **minimal, logically related changes**. Avoid mixing style fixes with functional changes.

## Pull Requests

- Follow the [Pull Request Guideline](https://github.com/fractalyze/.github/blob/main/PULL_REQUEST_GUIDELINE.md).
- Commits must be **atomic** and independently buildable/testable.
- Provide context and links (short SHA for external references).

## Tooling Requirements

- **Formatter:** `clang-format` (LLVM preset with project overrides). Refer to the `.clang-format` file in the repo.
- **Linter:** `clang-tidy`.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Recommended for enforcing format and lint locally.
- **CI:** All PRs must pass lint, format, and tests before merge.
